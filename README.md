This file contains a basic recreation of Team Cherry's site as it was in early 2022. Done for an assignment.

It only contains the main home page of the original, and no complex functionalities. I used it as a way to test myself in regards to the UI/UX design of the website.

For some reason, certain elements of the page are slightly off center or off position. This wasn't the case originally. I may come back and change this later, or I might try to recreate it again with better knowledge.
